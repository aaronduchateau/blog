Hey, I'm Aaron, and here is a little information about me and how my journey through life, and software.

### University of Oregon

I fell in love with software development in college. While i ultimately graduated with two degrees (Advertising and Digital Arts, with a minor in Business Administration) I began to explore applied web technologies during this time. I was looking for a path in life that allowed me to monitize a creative outlet, perpetually learn, and to work with smart people who stimulated me. Towards the end of college it became clear that software and applied web technology was going to be my space. While i never persued a CIS degree (foresight is the devil's lemonade), i did get my feet wet with a few CIS classes, and 'made it in' with the CIS guys at the <i>Social Science Instructional Lab</i>. 

By the time of graduation, i had succesfully delivered (and been paid for) a few simple web pages for local businesses, created an online booking system with a friend of mine (php, sql, javascript), and had written some functional, but ugly procedural code. 

### Freelancer into Business Owner

As i developed my skills as a software developer, so did the complexity of the projects i was taking on. After working a few miscelaneous jobs and freelancing on the side, i decided it was time to quit messing around, and take the plunge into being a full time developer and business owner. At this point me and a friend of mine decided to start <a href="GeniusMediaSolutions.com" target="_blank">GeniusMediaSolutions.com</a>. We created a super rough business plan, took out a loan, and even got ourselves an office downtown. We both devoted ourselves to the project full time, with no 'plan b'. Some of our portfolio pieces are still visible there today (see some of the projects i worked on at <a href="http://geniusmediasolutions.com/portfolio.html" target="_blank">Genius Media Soltions</a>). During this time i began to understand the importance of 'seperation of concerns', and a consideration for architecture. I started using frameworks more regularly in my projects, implimenting MVC design patterns, implimented version control (Git), and stopped viewing UI/UX as a purely subjective process. It was an exciting and busy time in my life. In one meeting i would be courting a client, and in the next moment i would be discussing finances of the business, designing layout, or writing backend code. It was during this time that i probably grew the most, but also learned even more, about what i didn't know. 

### Plunging into InSilico
While me and my partner had stabalized <i>Genius Media Soltions</i>, it became clear that we had different visions for the company. At this point I realized that it was hard to grow as in expert in the field when i was expected to be the expert, and code review the majority of my own code. It was also at this time that i got the chance to sell my equity in my company, and work for a new startup <i>InSilico</i> under Dan Keith, P.h.D. 

InSilico was a small team environment, and a good and exciting place to work. We were taking on new projects every 3 months or so, and in doing so we were constanlty playing with new technologies. It was at this point that i was exposed to node, web sockets, peer based code review, building native phone applications, noSql databases and a bunch of other exciting stuff. We spent most of our time in a coffee shop below our office, and embraced a 30 hour work week, with lots of free time to explore new technologies. 

After working at InSilico for over a year, the sun set on the start up (cash flow issues), and i began to realize it was time to shift in a different direction. I supported the direction and goals of InSilico, and we hung in with each other as long as we could, but sometimes cash flow issues are ... cash flow issues, and there isn't anything else to say. 

### Palo Alto Software (LivePlan)
At this point in time i had secured a good reputaiton as both a productive business guy, and solid developer downtown. I had a few friends working at Palo Alto in downtown Eugene, and they had good things to say, so i applied. I currently work on both the front end (React, Webpack) and backend (java) code base for <a href="http://www.liveplan.com/" target="_blank">LivePlan</a> It has been a good opportunity to work with a steller group of people, and i am constantly impressed with how smart everyone is on my team. I also have fallen in love with React, and it is fun to watch the stack grow in both popularity and functionality. As of July 5th 2015, I am still with Palo Alto, and work on projects that interest me on the side. 

### What I do in my free time, and what i like
As i mentioned above, i really love working in React.js client side. I also have fallen in love with online mapping applications, and am currently working on a rather robust project in my free time, that includes my own running instance of cartoDB, and leaflet. Anything react, anything mobile, anything 'mappy' or 'internet of things' is my jam.

I am also in the process of putting together a dream team of people who i like to work with, and who do more with their skill set when they get home from their day job than 'sit around and chill'. I have put in the time over a decade to not only become a better developer, but also develop relationships with the downtown eugene development community.
