title: Saving future you time, by saying thank you
---

In our day to day activities, we count on others. It could be as simple as a cup of coffee, or it could be that one piece of information you need to succeed during your busy ass day.

When people go out of their way to help you get something you need (and especially if they didn't suck at it), don't forget to 1) say thanks and 2) be mildly interesting in a positive way. If you're thinking, "Holy crap Aaron, what a HUGE waste of time!", I'll try to convince you it's worth it. 

My example assumes the individual in question has already proven that they can be competent and helpful to you in some regard. If they have already acted like a total shit bag, this method does not apply. 

Assuming above, likely means that dealing with this dude (or lady) in the future (rather than dealing with any OTHER member of the organization) is desirable in regards to your EFFORT and TIME. It is a fact that 99% of people in customer service positions are shit bags. This is usually a result of years of abuse, and (not unlike a damaged animal) this behavior on their end is understandable. When you find someone doing a customer service job whom you depend on who is not like this, you must latch onto them, and keep them in your grasp. 

Chances are they will remember you, and be even more helpful in the future if you follow a template, similar to the one below. As you read, notice the length of the email (this took less than 30 seconds to write). 

<i>Dear Gabe SnoddGrass,<br/>
I haven't opened the data yet, but the way i see it, you're the man. <br/>
Thanks for making this process unusually smooth (i.e. other counties I have dealt with). 

If you have children, or choose to have children, i'm sure they will be healthy and attractive!

Sincerely,<br/>

Now, let's review this email. I won't be addressing the 'subject' part of the email in this post. Captivating attention with email subjects has already been beaten to death by internet marketers, and in my opinion, isn't relevant to the point i'm trying to make. 

<b>1) The declaration of attention.</b><br/>
I chose to use his full name in this part of the email. This is weird, but not...too weird. While it may seem overly formal, it isn't inappropriate. I would even go so far as to say that there is something a bit primal about using the full name, as we all remember the jolt associated with our parents addressing us this way. Out of the gate we have tickled the 'unusual' button, and he will pay attention just a little bit more than he would have otherwise. 

<b>2) The first sentence: Protect yourself before saying thank you.</b><br/>
I didn't actually have time to open up the data he sent me, review it, and upload it to my map server. I did see however, that he delivered what I THINK he was supposed to deliver (in this case a zipped file, uploaded to dropbox), in a way that was totally EFFICIENT and BADASS. Unusually so for a government employee. Most of these government people send me actual cd's using 'snail mail'! THIS guy didn't do that. He actually talked to me (prior emails), and asked me how I wanted to receive the data i was purchasing. This guy ROCKS! 

Don't forget, i still need to protect myself incase the data he sent me has mistakes in it. This doesn't mean however, that i can't ALREADY say thank you for all of the bullshit he has already spared me. If there are mistakes we can deal with that later. At that point, im going to want him to get back to me quickly, because by then, I will most likely give 10x 'more of a shit'. This is why it is important to say "thank you", RIGHT NOW. I start saying thank you, by calling him "The Man". 

No one that's a dude, doesn't like to be called "The Man". If there is a lady involved, you can of course adjust your strategy accordingly, but you get the idea. 

<b>3) The second sentence: Make him aware that you recognize he is superior to his peers.</b><br/>
This sounds a bit manipulative, but it's not. I actually feel this way about this guy. I compare him to others that also do his job in the world, and say he is BETTER than them. I can give him this honest feedback, and from an evolutionary standpoint (or as a fallback, deeply suppressed issues of self worth) hit a chord. We all want to be better than the other monkeys, and I am telling him that he is. 

He will like this. Even if i stopped here, he would probably remember me, but since we've gone this far, let's wrap it up with a home run. 

<b>4) The final sentence: The outlandish compliment</b><br/>
Topically, out of the entire email i wrote, this sentence is both the least and the most important. While it does nothing to communicate anything of apparent significance, it shows him that I am taking time out of my day to joke around a bit, and express an 'over the top' compliment. The length of this part of the email must be kept short, as the more data i pile into the email that isn't necessary on his end, could inversely make his time feel wasted. The outlandish compliment should be kept to a single sentence, and use language that won't blend in with the other 100 emails he will undoubtedly be responding to during his day. 

<b>5) Signature: Professional, with contact information front and center</b><br/>
If there ever was an issue, the more time Gabe Snoddgrass (i swear this actually IS the guys name by the way) has to spend getting in touch with me, the more frustrated we all become. When signing emails, provide people with multiple ways to contact you. Gmail and most other email applications allow you to pre populate the footer, yet for some reason i often interact with people in a professional sense, you don't take the 3 seconds it requires to set this up. Additionally, it also prevents errors which can easily happen if you type this shit out everyday. 

<b>Conclusion:</b><br/>
Gabe SnoddGrass wrote me back. Here is what he said:

<i>No problem Aaron.  I hope the data provides useful.  Have a good week.<br/>
-Gabe</i>

This entire transaction went exactly as planned. He clearly stated it was no trouble (even though it actually was trouble for him to produce the deliverable i needed). He expressed a desire that the data he provided me with would be kickass (paraphrasing of course). Lastly, he wished me a good week (something he didn't have to do, but chose to).

I will never meet Gabe SnoddGrass face to face, but we are now on amicable, if not friendly terms. It turned out that the data he gave me was perfect and there was no issue, but if there HAD been an issue, my follow up email of "Hey man, sorry to bother you but..." would possibly get a little extra attention, don't you think? I hopefully made this guy's day a little bit better, and definitely secured my position as something to him, greater than a ticket number. I believe that disseminating positive energy into the universe is always a good thing, but even for purely selfish reasons, being cool to people, can produce positive results.
